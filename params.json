Unfortunately the paper didn't include\r\n        code to test it, so I decided to reproduce it here on the web!\r\n      </p>\r\n      <video muted autoplay=\"autoplay\" loop=\"loop\" controls width=\"700\" height=\"300\">\r\n        <source src=\"example.ogv\" type=\"video/ogg\">\r\n      </video>\r\n\r\n      <h2>What is the doppler effect?</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        First of all, what is the doppler effect?\r\n        The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect\">doppler effect</a> is a physical phenomenom which affects waves in motion.\r\n        The standard example is the effect on a fire engine siren as it quickly drives\r\n        past. When it moves <i>towards</i> you the sound waves are compressed, and so the\r\n        frequency becomes <i>higher</i>, and\r\n        when it moves <i>away</i> from you the frequency becomes <i>lower</i>.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <div id=\"doppler-video\"></div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        This phenomenon actually has really wonderful applications in astronomy for figuring the speed\r\n        at which galaxies are moving towards or away from us by looking at the frequency shift of light,\r\n        but I digress.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Anyway, it's important to realize that the doppler effect would also occur\r\n        if you were to run towards the siren, rather than the siren moving towards you.\r\n        We'll use this principle in the next section.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h2>Measuring the doppler effect</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        In order to measure the doppler effect for motion detection on a conventional computer,\r\n        what you can do is send out a sinusoid at some known (inaudible) frequency, say, 20 kHz.\r\n        If something is moving in the room, then, after the sinusoid has bounced around on the walls and into the microphone, the\r\n        sound will shift in frequency. This can be measured by looking at the frequency spectrum\r\n        in the nearby region of the 20 kHz tone.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <div>\r\n        <canvas id=\"spectrum\" width=\"700\" height=\"100\"></canvas>\r\n        <button id=\"btn-activate\" class=\"pure-button pure-button-primary\">Press to see the effect of a 20 kHz tone, after it has bounced around the room</button>\r\n        <div id=\"spectrum-axes\">\r\n          <span class=\"left-axis\">0 kHz</span><span class=\"right-axis\">22 kHz</span>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <span class=\"warn\">Note that you'll need to run Chrome with a fairly high speaker-volume for this to work optimally.</span>\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The frequency spectrum of the microphone input is plotted above. The peak towards the right\r\n        is due to the 20 kHz tone we're sending out. Try <span data-note=\"440\" class=\"data-note\">whistling</span> to see the spectrum change.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <div>\r\n        <canvas id=\"spectrum-zoom\" width=\"700\" height=\"100\"></canvas>\r\n        <div id=\"spectrum-zoom-axes\">\r\n          <span class=\"left-axis\">19 kHz</span> <span class=\"right-axis\">21 kHz</span>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Here's a closer look, zooming in on the 20 kHz region.\r\n        Try moving your hand <i>towards</i>\r\n        the mic/computer to see the bulge shift to <i>higher</i> frequencies, and\r\n        <i>away</i> from the computer to see it shift to <i>lower</i> frequencies.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h2>Applications</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Now for the fun applications!\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h3>Motion sensing</h3>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The most obvious application for this is motion sensing.\r\n        Below I've calculated the left and right bandwidth of the 20 kHz\r\n        region (defined as the number of frequencies to the left and right\r\n        that are within 99.9% in amplitude of the 20 kHz tone).\r\n        I've then attached their difference to the size of the box.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <canvas id=\"ball\" width=\"700\" height=\"100\"></canvas>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The effect this produces is that when you move your hand <i>towards</i>\r\n        the microphone, the box becomes smaller (you're <i>pushing</i>\r\n        it inwards), and if you move your hand <i>away</i> from the microphone,\r\n        the box becomes larger (you're <i>pulling</i> it outwards).\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h3>Scrolling</h3>\r\n      <div id=\"scrolling-video\"></div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        A cool application to motion sensing, as suggested by the\r\n        <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/groups/cue/publications/guptasoundwavechi2012.pdf\">SoundWave paper</a>,\r\n        is scrolling (see the video above). Click below to try it out.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <div id=\"scroll-btn-container\">\r\n        <button id=\"scroll-btn\"\r\n                class=\"pure-button pure-button-primary\"\r\n                data-active-text=\"Stop scrolling hands-free\"\r\n                data-inactive-text=\"Start scrolling hands-free\">\r\n          Start hands-free scrolling\r\n        </button>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        This implementation doesn't have the double-tap feature for reversing\r\n        the scrolling-direction, instead it's just using the left and right bandwidth-difference.\r\n        Thus if you want to scroll down you have to move your hand\r\n        <i>quickly towards</i> the computer, and <i>slowly away</i> from the computer.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h3>Theremin</h3>\r\n      <div id=\"theremin-video\"></div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        We can also create an instrument with this by simply modulating\r\n        the frequency of some base-tone, say at 440 Hz, based on the\r\n        difference between the left and right bandwidth!\r\n      </p>\r\n      <div id=\"theremin-btn-container\">\r\n        <button id=\"theremin-btn\"\r\n                class=\"pure-button pure-button-primary\"\r\n                data-active-text=\"Stop instrument\"\r\n                data-inactive-text=\"Start instrument\">\r\n          Start instrument\r\n        </button>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        This is reminiscent of a Theremin, in that you can contol\r\n        sound by moving your hands in free space, yet different\r\n        in that the Theremin is able to measure absolute distance from the base,\r\n        whereas we can only measure relative motion.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <h2>Library</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Did this give you any ideas?
